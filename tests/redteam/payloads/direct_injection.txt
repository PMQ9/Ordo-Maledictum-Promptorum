DEFENSIVE TESTING COMMITMENT
========================================

This payload library is part of a DEFENSIVE TESTING ONLY exercise.
These attacks are used to verify the Intent Segregation Architecture's defenses:

Defense Layers:
1. Vault of the Forbidden Cant - Zero-trust input testing on sacrificial LLM sentries
2. Multi-Parser Consensus - 3 independent LLMs extract intent (≥95% similarity required)
3. Voting Engine - Consensus voting on parser outputs
4. Policy Comparator - Security boundary enforcement
5. Human-in-Loop - Escalation for conflicts and high-risk operations
6. Immutable Ledger - Audit trail of all operations

Never use these payloads for actual attacks or unauthorized testing.
All testing is conducted on isolated, sandboxed systems with explicit authorization.
